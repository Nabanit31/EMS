Employee Management System (EMS)
This project is a Multi-page application built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, designed to streamline task management for a small team. It features role-based access for administrators and employees, ensuring a tailored and efficient user experience.

Key Features

Role-Based Dashboards: The system provides distinct dashboards for different user roles (e.g., admin, employee) to manage tasks effectively. This customization led to a 

30% improvement in user experience for the six-user team. 


Advanced Admin Task Management: Administrators can create and manage a high volume of tasks (over 25), assigning up to 10 tasks per user. The interface includes a custom scrollbar for easy navigation through the task list. 


Real-Time Task Tracking: Employees can view a live count of their tasks, categorized as active, new, completed, or failed, allowing for better workload management. 


Persistent Sessions: The application uses localStorage to maintain user sessions. This means users are not required to log in again, even after reloading the page.

Here to View the Admin page use the email : admin@gmail.com and password:123.

and For employee login use the email : {(Employee Name)(Camel case)}@gmail.com  password:123
                            for example -> Employee email : Sneha@gmail.com and password : 123
while Assigning the task please use the camel case white assigning the Task.
